# weather-forecast

the website we are using to scrape data.

# A build to fetch upcoming 7 seven day forecast.

# Features:

* This program will scrape weather forecast for the next **seven days**. The data will be scraped from this [website](https://www.weather.gov/)
* store the forecast into a new file.

# Features to be added:
New features will be added over time to stay tuned and follow me on [GITHUB](github.com/hassancodes)

* store data into a file of your own choice(csv, txt, excel etc).
* custom longitude and latitudes input(if achieve able).
* location input by user
* Hope if we do this far. We will definitely make a gui version of this.

Thanks to all.
